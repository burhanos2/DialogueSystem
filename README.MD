# DialogueSystem in Unity
This is a dialogue system that will read lines from XML files. It will also have branching dialogue paths.

## Features
Links to bits of code.
{WIP}
- [Dialogue scripts](/Assets/Scripts/Dialogue)
- [Scenario scripts](/Assets/Scripts/Scenario)
- [Looping beat I made as background sound](/Assets/Sounds/Music/beat.ogg)

## Software Analysis
I have decided to opt with Unity C# because I have the most experience in Unity, so that way I will have less obstacles to overcome that are related to the software.

## Learning Goals
- Understanding how to take text from XML into code.
- Improving my skills in C#.
- Understanding how to manage branching dialogue paths.

## Planning 
I will have 1 week and 3 days for each one of these portfolio exercises. 
The remaining 2 days of week #2 will be spent implementing it into my portfolio, reflecting on the process and picking/planning the next exercise.

| | monday | tuesday | wednesday | thursday | friday |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|week 1 | picking and setting up| creating the base, a dialogue system of set text. | adding branching paths to it. | make it read from an XML file | make it look better. | 
|week 2 | write dialogue for immersion purposes| let others test it/check out the sourcecode | polish/clean up code bits | reflection | adding it to my portfolio |
